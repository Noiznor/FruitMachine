The Fruit Juice Vending Machine System is a software application designed to manage the sale of various fruit juice beverages in an automated manner. The system allows users to select from a range of available juices, each with a specified price, and facilitates payment processing.


Key Features:
**Juice Selection**: Users can choose from a list of available juices, such as Orange, Apple, Grape, and Pineapple, each displaying its price.

**Payment Processing**: The system supports multiple payment methods, including cash in dollars and cents. It allows users to insert the appropriate amount based on the selected juice's price.

**Change Calculation**: If the total amount inserted exceeds the juice price, the system calculates and provides the correct change to the user.
